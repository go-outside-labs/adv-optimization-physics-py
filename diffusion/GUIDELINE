Diffusion / parabolic PDEs and multiphysics
	Lecture Notes: diffusion.pdf
	Readings
		diffusion.pdf (notes on the diffusion equation)
		On the Construction and Comparison of Difference Schemes by G. Strang (1968)
	Examples
		Time-explicit diffusion on a cell-centered grid: diffexplicit.py
		Backward-difference (implicit) diffusion: diffimplicit.py
		Crank-Nicolson differenced diffusion (direct solve): diffCNimplicit.py
		Multigrid solution of diffusion (C-N discretization): diffMG.py
		Diffusion-reaction equation, using Strang-splitting (this can be thought of as a model for a flame): diffreact.py
		Viscous burgers equation (2nd-order piecewise linear f-v method for advection + 2nd-order implicit method for diffusion): burgervisc.py
