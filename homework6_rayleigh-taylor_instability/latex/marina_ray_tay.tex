{\bf Implement a model of {\it Rayleigh-Taylor instability} in the  \texttt{pyro code} \cite{pyro}.}}

\quad


\begin{enumerate}
\item The {\it initial conditions} for density defines a heavy fluid over a light fluid, separated by an interface:
$$
\rho = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
\rho_{\rm down}  &\mbox{ if } y < 0.5 \cdot y_{\rm center}  \\
 \rho_{\rm up}  &\mbox{ if } y \geq 0.5 \cdot y_{\rm center}  ,
       \end{array} \right.
$$
where $\rho_{\rm up}>\rho_{\rm down}$ are {\bf arbitrary inputs} and $y_{\rm center} = y_{\rm min} + y_{\rm max}$.

\quad


\item The {\it evolution} for pressure is given by hydrostatic equilibrium for the gravity constant, $g$,
$$ \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} + \rho g = 0,$$
which translates as
$$
p = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 p_0 + \rho_{\rm down }\cdot g \cdot y  &\mbox{ if } y< 0.5 \cdot y_{\rm center}  \\
 p_0 + \rho_{\rm down}  \cdot g  \cdot y_{\rm center} + \rho_{\rm up} \cdot g \cdot (y - y_{\rm center})  &\mbox{ if } y \geq 0.5 \cdot y_{\rm center} ,
       \end{array} \right.
$$
where $p_0$ is an {\bf arbitrary input}.

\quad

\item The {\it perturbation} is applied to the $y$-velocity,
$$ v = A \sin(2 \pi x/ L_x) \cdot e^{-(y-y_{\rm center})^2/\sigma^2},$$
and should be small, where $A$ is the amplitude and $\sigma$ the vertical extent of the perturbation, both {\bf arbitrary inputs}.

\quad

\item The {\it boundary conditions} are {\it periodic} on the sides ($x$) and {\it reflecting} at the top and 
bottom ($y$).

\quad

\item The {\it domain} is made {\it tall}, with $y \in [0,3]$ and {\it narrow}, with $x \in [0,1]$.

\end{enumerate}


\quad

Using the following input parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho_{\rm down} = 1.0, $
\item $\rho_{\rm up} =0.2$,
\item $p_0 = 1.0$,
\item $g =1.0$.
\end{itemize}


\quad 

We test many possibilities for the perturbation parameters, $A$ and $\sigma$. First, if $A$ is too large, \eg $A=0.8$, it quickly creates shocks, which interferes with the process, as we can see in the Fig. \ref{ev}.

\label{ev}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\quad


If we set $\sigma$ to be too small, the fluid only propagates, as we can see in the Fig. \ref{ev2}.

\quad

\begin{figure} [ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/g_98A_15_sig001_fail_stoosmall_200x600/1.png}

\caption{Rayleigh-Taylor instability not seen and interfered by shocks: here $\sigma$  is too small. $A=1.0$ and $\sigma=0.001$, grid $[200,600]$}
\label{ev2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\quad

The tuning is important in this problem. Reducing $A$ and increasing $\sigma$ to find a good development of the  perturbation in the plane dividing the two liquids, avoiding shocks. For example, we make $A=0.1, \sigma =0.1$, as in Fig. \ref{ev3}, the RT-instability still did not have enough time to form before the shock.

\quad

\caption{Rayleigh-Taylor instability not clear: increasing  $\sigma=0.1$ and decreasing $A=0.1$, still is not enough. Meshes: $[200,600]$}
\label{ev3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\quad

A set of parameters that showed  the RT-instability without being interfered by shock to the boundaries were $\sigma =0.4$ and $A=0.1$, as we can see in the Fig. \ref{ev4}.

\quad


To compare resolution, we run the same parameters above but with a smaller grid, [100, 300]. Altought the RT-instabilities seems to appears fast (smaller grids), they present very low resolution, as we see in the Fig. \ref{ev5}.
