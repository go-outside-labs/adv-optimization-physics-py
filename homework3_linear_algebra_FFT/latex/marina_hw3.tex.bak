\question{Q.3}{\texttt{{\bf(Time Series)} {\bf The equation of motion for a damped driven pendulum is:
$$ml \frac{d\theta^2}{dt^2} = F_g + F_d + F_r,$$
where $\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum from vertical, $F_r = f_0 \cos(\omega_d)$ is the driving force with amplitude $f_0$ and driving frequency $\omega_d$, $F_d = \kappa \nu$ is the resistive force and $F_g = mg \sin (\theta)$ is the gravitational force on the pendulum. We can write this as a system of the form:
$$\frac{\theta}{dt} = \omega,$$
$$\frac{\omega}{dt}Ë™ = -q \omega - \sin(\theta) + b \cos (\omega_d),$$
where $q$ is a {\it scaled damping coefficient} and $b$ is a {\it scaled forcing amplitude}. We also took $l = g$ to simplify things.}}}} 




\begin{enumerate}

\item[1.] We integrate this system using {\it 4th-order Runge-Kutta} and a {\it uniform timestep} (equally spaced points to do Fourier analysis). We chose the parameters $q = 0.5$, $b = 0.9$, and $\omega_d=2/3$. We integrate for tmax = 100 periods and we pick a timestep dt = 0.05 that gives a converged solution. We plot $\omega - \theta$ (left top plots in the below figures) and we can see the period motion for $0.5 \leq b<10.0$.

\item[2.] We perform the {\it discrete Fourier transform} (DFT) of $\theta(t)$ and plot the power spectrum for values $0.5 \leq b\leq 13.5$ (figures above), where for $b\geq 10.0$ the behaviour is chaotic.
